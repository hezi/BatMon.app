WHAT IS IT ?
------------

Battery Monitor displays information about your laptop battery. Information include expected battery life, amperage and voltage.


NOTES
-----
- batmon parses the ACPI information exposed by the linux kernel inside the /proc pseudo filesystem. Thus it probably works with 2.6 kernels which layout the same information and with the same keywords as the laptop I use.
